<h2 style="color:#ed1a3b;">Shaping Singapore’s Tech Landscape, One Policy at a Time</h2>

<p>Digital trust is becoming increasingly valuable as more Singaporeans and businesses here move online. With this trend, new norms of security and trust are emerging and evolving.</p> 

<p>And it is in this space that Jin Chong, who works in the Policy and Technology department of the Infocomm Media Development Authority, operates in. His role involves formulating and reviewing policies to make sure businesses who use citizens’ data do so responsibly. </p>

<p>“There is a role for everyone to contribute to the growth and development of Singapore’s digital economy. I chose to do policy work because I find it most fulfilling to work on solutions that benefit consumers and organisations alike,” says Jin Chong. </p>

<p>“In IMDA, I get to experience that by being part of the governance team looking to strengthen Singapore as a trusted digital innovation hub,” he adds.</p>

<h3 style="color:#212121;">FOSTERING INNOVATION</h3>

<p>It’s not all about policies either. Rather, it’s about seizing the opportunities thrown up by tech changes through a more agile, enabling approach to regulation. For instance, he and his colleagues would inform and guide organisations looking into tech such as biometrics on using and protecting data responsibly. </p>

<p> “A start-up was exploring using biometrics to increase security and convenience to hotel guests, and it approached PDPC for guidance on how to do so while protecting guests’ data,” Jin Chong recounts. </p>

<p>“This was an interesting case that widened my perspective on the development of innovative inter-disciplinary tech solutions, which have the potential to address complex challenges and benefit organisations and individuals.”</p>

<p>This opportunity of helping innovators design, develop and deploy their solutions responsibly is something he values.</p>

<p>And to be able to come up with relevant policies and provide meaningful guidance, Jin Chong has to be able to understand the technology as well as gather viewpoints from all stakeholders.</p>

<p>“I often find myself weaving together technological and legal developments as well as businesses’ and consumers’ interests in order to glean insights,” Jin Chong shares. “My colleagues and I would also actively engage various internal and external stakeholders, to obtain different perspectives or to validate our thinking on an issue. </p>

<p>“I look forward to these meetings because they are intellectually stimulating and provide new perspectives,” he adds.  </p>

<h3 style="color:#212121;">MORE THAN JUST A JOB</h3>

<p>Ultimately, a career in tech policy is more than a job; it’s about helping Singapore achieve its Smart Nation ambitions and leveraging growth opportunities in today’s digital economy, he says.</p>

<p>“Many of us enjoy the benefits and convenience of a Smart Nation such as personalised content and recommendations when buying on e-commerce platforms,” Jin Chong says. </p>

<p>“My work allows me to play a part in maintaining the trust between consumers and firms to enable a flourishing and vibrant digital economy.”</p>

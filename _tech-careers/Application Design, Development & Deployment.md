<br><strong><em>Apple Chan</em></strong><em><br>Lead Consultant (Application), CPFB<br>Joined in 2009</em>
<br>
<br>“I started off as a Consultant and was tasked to assist and support the
end users operationally on government agency projects. Subsequently, I
moved on to a greater role in managing and delivering new projects that
arose from the Singapore Budget Announcement, specifically on Covid-19
relief package. I also had the opportunity to work on an interesting customer
relationship management (CRM) project which involved multiple stakeholders
and interlinking requirements between CPF systems. These projects were
mostly time sensitive and often had to be delivered within short time frames.
But a successful roll out of each project gives me immense satisfaction.”

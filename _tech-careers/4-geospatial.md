### **Geospatial**

The Geospatial domain is at the centre of change. Here, it’s all about the ‘where’ of data and importantly, what it can lead to with Smart Nation thinking and talent.

Beyond information on a map, geospatial possibilities harness the management and analysis of patterns, trends, distributions and concentrations. This enables a holistic understanding of the data and helps Singapore’s government and businesses make better informed decisions and improve services. Geospatial information and technology also do wonders in our daily lives. Your go-to applications and tools for private hire, food delivery, navigation, etc, all make use of geospatial information and technology.

Geospatial is multi-disciplinary, encompassing the areas of Mapping and Remote Sensing, Geospatial Data and Database Management, Geospatial Information System (GIS) Design, Development and Management, and Geospatial Modelling and Analysis. Your Geospatial journey will bring you across many areas of change. You could help lead the drive to a GeoSmart Government, accelerate Singapore’s thriving GeoIndustry, and use location insights and information to bring about a GeoEmpowered community.

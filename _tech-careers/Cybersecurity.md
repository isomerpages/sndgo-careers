<h3><strong>Cybersecurity</strong></h3>
<p>Secure our cyberspace to enable Singapore to be a safe and secure Smart
Nation.</p>
<p>As Singapore harnesses technology to improve lives and livelihoods for
all, our plans must be built on a strong foundation of cybersecurity. In
cybersecurity, you will hunt for cyber threats, investigate breaches and
fortify our cyberspace and defence systems to build a resilient and trusted
cyber environment. The work will never be mundane in this challenging and
fast-moving environment.</p>
<p>There are career opportunities in incident response, threat hunting, penetration
testing, research and development in new technologies and systems. Be involved
in driving Singapore’s cyber and digital security diplomacy efforts internationally,
and the exciting work in other cybersecurity-related roles.</p>
<p>Be our next generation of cybersecurity leaders. Join us to shape, transform
and safeguard our cyber landscape.</p>
<h3><strong>Hear from our tech talents</strong></h3>

<br>“I strengthen the cybersecurity of MINDEF and the Singapore Armed Forces

I also work with Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to address the shortcomings
in their tools in meeting our deployment needs. It’s meaningful to know
my efforts make cloud systems more secure and reliable for our users.”

<br><strong><em>Ong Chee Siang</em></strong><em><br>Lead System Engineer (Cloud), CPFB<br>Joined in 2016</em>
<br>
<br>“My current role requires me to explore Government Commercial Cloud (GCC)
and support the moving of our CPFB systems to GCC, as well as introduce
new cloud initiatives for the Board. This is something my colleagues and
I have not done before. Being the first team to move to GCC was a challenge
as we had to figure out how to build and operate systems in a totally new
environment, which took many rounds of iterations.”

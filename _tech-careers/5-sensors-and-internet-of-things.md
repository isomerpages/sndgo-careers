### **Sensors & Internet of Things**

Harness the many possibilities Sensors and the Internet of Things (SIOT) can bring about, across anything and everything from smart homes and gardens, to large-scale assisted living ecosystems, community wellness enablers and state-of-the-art public security systems. 

Our SIOT solutions improve the efficiency and efficacy of public service officers in performing city operations and delivering citizen-centric services. As a SIOT engineer, you are empowered to take charge of the end-to-end engineering process, working alongside passionate and technically competent co-workers to build and deploy platforms and system that scale from 1 to 1,000,000.

Join one of our many teams on meaningful projects that impact the nation. The Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP) connects a shared network of sensors that collects and analyses data to enable smarter decisions on city planning and the delivery of citizen-centric public services. Or build the next surveillance and sensemaking system that is a force-multiplier for the system and brain of our homeland security forces. Our SIOT solutions meet the needs of diverse groups – from the elderly (IoT Panic Alert Button) to people with special needs (eCanvas assistive technology) to the general populace (TraceTogether Tokens for contact tracing). There’s much more to come.

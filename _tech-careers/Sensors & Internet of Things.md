<h3><strong>Sensors &amp; Internet of Things</strong></h3>
<p>Harness the many possibilities Sensors and the Internet of Things (SIOT)
can bring about, across anything and everything from smart homes and gardens,
to large-scale assisted living ecosystems, community wellness enablers
and state-of-the-art defence and public security systems.</p>
<p>Our SIOT solutions improve the efficiency and efficacy of public service
officers in performing city operations and delivering citizen-centric services.
As a SIOT engineer, you are empowered to take charge of the end-to-end
engineering process, working alongside passionate and talented engineers
to build and deploy platforms and systems that scale from 1 to 1,000,000.</p>
<p>Join one of our many teams to implement meaningful projects that impact
the nation. The Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP) connects a shared network
of sensors that collects and analyses data to enable smarter decisions
on city planning and the delivery of citizen-centric services. Or build
the next generation surveillance and sensemaking system that is a force-multiplier
for our defence and homeland security forces. Our SIOT solutions meet the
needs of diverse groups – from NSmen (enhancing the NS experience through
digital innovations) to the elderly (IoT Personal Alert Button) and people
with special needs (eCanvas assistive technology) as well as the general
populace (TraceTogether Tokens for contact tracing). There’s much more
to come.</p>

<h3><strong>Geospatial</strong></h3>
<p>Model, simulate and analyse the urban environment. Plan and manage city
operations effectively. Visualise and experiment with assets digitally.</p>
<p>Beyond the display of information on a map, geospatial information and
technology enables government and businesses to analyse patterns and generate
insights to make more informed decisions and execute seamless operations.
In addition, Geospatial information and technology is essential to our
daily lives, driving everyday applications such as private hire, food delivery,
and navigation.</p>
<p>Geospatial is multi-faceted, encompassing the areas of: Mapping and Remote
Sensing, Geospatial Data and Database Management, Geospatial Information
System (GIS) Design, Development and Management, and Geospatial Modelling
and Analysis. When you choose a career as a Geospatial Engineer, you embark
on a journey of discovery and change.</p>
<p>The deep expertise you develop will drive Singapore’s digital transformation
into a Smart Nation.</p>
